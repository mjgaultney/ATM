# My-Daily-Chores

## Description
This program is a simple ATM exercise for keeping track of how much money you deposite and withdraw from your personal account. (in this case Migo's)

## How to run
Download the files to a directory on your computer and open the index.html file into you web browswer. Practice depositing money and withdrawing it and allow the program to keep track. 

## Future Improvements
Update the interface to where it looks like a real ATM console. Or set it so that there is a section to switch between accounts (savings/investments)
